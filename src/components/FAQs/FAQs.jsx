      question: "How does the implementation of 3D look?",
      answer: "There are multiple 3D model uses. Creating CGI images for your product showcase requires no implementation; we will deliver the final, ready-to-use image for you. As for the Augmented Reality experience, the process is simple: we will generate an embeddable link or a QR code of your 3D product model, which you'll be able to add to your website or offline media. No additional coding, software, or extensions are needed."
    },

      question: "How will I know how many views my 3D viewers have generated?",
      answer: "You can see statistics regarding the view count on each 3D viewer in your Modelry dashboard."

      question: "How AR and 3D Models can benefit your business?",

      question: "What do I need to have a 3D model created?",
